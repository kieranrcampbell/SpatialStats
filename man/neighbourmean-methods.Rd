\usage{
neighbourMean(object, useWeights, normalise)

\S4method{neighbourMean}{SPData,logical,logical}(object, useWeights, normalise)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{The SPData object to use}

\item{useWeights}{If TRUE then the mean is weighted using the
relative boundary weights. If FALSE then the normal mean is taken
over the nearest neighbours.}

\item{normalise}{If TRUE each channel is centre-scaled to mean 0
and standard deviation 1.}
}
\value{
A matrix of dimension \emph{n} by \emph{p} for
\emph{n} cells and \emph{p} nearest neighbours.
}
\description{
Given the nearest neighbour measurements, average over the
nearest neighbours of each cell, with optional boundary
weights.
